# Hi there, I'm an AI Engineer

Currently exploring how to apply **deep learning** and **transfer learning** into medical fields.

### What I’ve been building:
- **Alzheimer’s Disease Image Classification** → A Keras-based convolutional neural network pipeline for multi-class classification of Alzheimer’s-related brain images with up to 90% accuracy.
- **Halodoc App Review Sentiment Analysis Classification** → With three sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral), the MLP model with TF-IDF achieved the highest accuracy of 92%.
- **Bank Customers Habits Clustering and Classification** → Two-stage machine learning pipeline on bank transaction data: unsupervised clustering (KMeans + PCA) followed by supervised classification (Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest)

### Tech Stack:
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, networkX, **TensorFlow**, dan **PyTorch**
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, VSCode, Docker, Azure, MLFlow, Grafana, Prometheus 

### Currently learning:
- Transfer Learning
- Image Pre Processing for Medical Image
- Computer Vision for Medical Image

### ✨ Fun fact:
I love cats.
