# Hi there, I'm a Data Scientist 👋

I love building **AI-powered** and **data-driven** projects 🚀.  
Currently exploring how to apply **machine learning** and **data science** to solve real-world problems.

### ⚡ What I’ve been building:
- 🏷️ **KNN-based Auction Verification System** → built from scratch using Python & pandas
- 🏦 **Deposit Classification** → stacking ensemble model with XGBoost & Random Forest
- 📉 **Linear Regression-Based Stock Depletion Prediction** → for mobile & web apps
- 🌫️ **Fuzzy Logic-Based Health Risk Prediction** → using U.S. Pollution Dataset (AQI, SO₂, O₃, NO₂, CO)

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, networkX, TensorFlow, dan PyTorch
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, VSCode

### 🌱 Currently learning:
- Deep learning (TensorFlow, Keras)
- NLP
- Generative AI

### ✨ Fun fact:
I love cats.
